# The Liphium website, reimagined with Hugo
I've tried out a couple of frameworks for building websites today and Hugo just seemed like the best option by far cause we can now use Markdown to easily edit the entire site without having to go into the HTML. That's gonna make things way easier for translation and more stuff. I'm also excited to get the blog working so I can finally publish some posts.
