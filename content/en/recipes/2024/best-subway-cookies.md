You can find normal Subway cookie recipes everywhere on the internet. In fact, you can even just buy those kind of cookies straight from the convenience store. But as everyone in my friends group knows, I always mix things up. And there is one particular ingredient that I always try to combine with the stuff I make: **Dried Raspberries**. But even if you don't like raspberries, you can basically combine everything with this cookie recipe and get something that tastes really good. Bananas are also good, but we'll focus on dried raspberries for this one, because it's the one and only thing that I've kept adding because it was so good I couldn't get enough of it.

Also just as a quick note, this recipe was based on [this recipe](https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/2257651361176625/Subway-Cookies.html) I found on Chefkoch (a German recipe sharing site) and modified a little bit. The main thing I did is basically add more things that go into the cookie since that's what makes them so good in the first place. Thanks to the original author for making such a good base recipe. If there are any problems with me publishing this recipe with modifications let me know!

But let's get started now. You can find what ingredients you need on the right of this text if you are on desktop or by clicking the button in the bottom right on mobile.

### The flour situation

This might first feel like a little bit of a weird tangent. But let me explain. Different types of flour makes the cookies taste different and it's something you can definitely notice. I've gone as far as to do [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) with this recipe and found that in my opinion spelt flour tastes the best with these cookies. But your taste may vary, so it's your choice which one you prefer.

## Now, how do I make those cookies?

### Prepare the ingredients

**1.** Since the dried raspberries most likely still look like raspberries after you bought them, we have to change that a little bit. Cutting them with a knife is tedious, so what I suggest is just breaking them apart one by one. I know that can take some time, but it's what I do, just make sure to break them into small chunks but not turning them into a complete powder. Some powder is always gonna be there, but that's fine.

**2.** Now it's time to cut the chocolate. Describing the size for something like this can be difficult but what I tend to do is literally cutting it into cubes. The thickness of the chocolate is how big the cube should roughly be. That's the closest description I can think off to be honest.

I really need to add pictures to show how I cut this stuff, next time when I make cookies I'll definitely update this page to show the proper size.

### Making the dough

**1.** Take the butter and the sugar, put them into a bowl and mix them using a hand mixer until the mixture looks nice and creamy.

**2.** Add the eggs to the bowl and mix it a little more until it's a lot more creamy.

**3.** Now, take a second bowl and mix flour, baking soda and salt in there. Make sure they're mixed well. If you don't do this properly the cookies won't turn out that great (I have experience..).

**4.** Following that, take the butter and sugar mixture and pour it into the second bowl where you just mixed the flour with all the other stuff.

Now before we get to step five I need you to listen to me loud and clear, alright? From now on, **NO HAND MIXER ALLOWED**. Did you hear that? **NO HAND MIXER ALLOWED**. If you use a hand mixer for the next few steps it'll ruin the entire taste and potentially break the chocolate into smaller parts and your cookies will become chocolate cookies. We don't want that, do we? So don't use a hand mixer. Thanks.

**5.** Now mix the things in the second bowl together using a spoon and be careful with it. Once the things look mixed together it's time to stop. Once there is no more flour visible, the dough is perfect.

**6.** Alright, final step, add the chocolate and dried raspberries into there and mix it all together properly (also using a spoon). Make sure there is also enough at the bottom for the last few cookies. Otherwise you'll end up with a bunch of only dough cookies. Trust me, those are not as good as the other ones.

### Finally, it's time for cooki(e)ng

**1.** First let's prepare the oven for our delicious cookies. To do that heat it at 190Â°C fan (convection) and wait until that temperature is reached before you put in the first tray.

**2.** To prepare the tray, take two sheets of parchment paper and put them onto it. Two sheets make sure the cookies aren't burnt since that's something that happens way too easily. I'm **not** saying this based on personal experience.

**3.** Place dough mounds the size of plums on the parchment paper and press them down slightly. Make sure roughly 12 fit onto the entire tray. That's just the perfect amount as these things will spread out. And you don't want to end up with cookie pizza.

**4.** Now put them into the oven for roughly 10-13 minutes and that's it. Only thing is that they will be a little bit fragile once you take them out. So make sure to let them cool for like 20 minutes and after that you should be fine.
